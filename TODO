Source/library stuff:

 - Heh, forgot to implement the FontSize manipulator.
 - Port to Windows.
 - Add color allocation interface to Device or maybe Ink, possibly an allocator
   -> See g2_allocate_basic_colors, g2_clear_palette, and
      g2_reset_palette
 - Add physical device handles interface? (probably not)
   -> See g2_get_pd_handles
 - Universal ink colors (i.e. no color allocation until necessary)
 - Doxygen documentation--lots of it.

Package/Installation stuff:

 - Get the header files to install into $PREFIX/include/g2++
 - Perhaps, somehow, get the installer to symlink g2++.h to g2++
